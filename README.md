# Puck.js Experiments

A collection of some of my expirements with [Puck.js](https://www.espruino.com/Puck.js). This is a work in progress.

## Experiments
### [3d.html](https://bschoun.github.io/Puck/3d.html)
Rotates a 3D model from Puck accel/gyro/mag data using the Madgwick algorithm. There seems to be an issue with heading.

### [3d-no-mag.html](https://bschoun.github.io/Puck/3d-no-mag.html)
Rotates a 3D model from Puck accel/gyro data only (no mag) using the Madgwick algorithm. Seems to behave better without the mag.

### [data.html](https://bschoun.github.io/Puck/data.html)
Rotates a 3D model and plots linear acceleration. Linear accel data may not be correct or as good as it could be.
